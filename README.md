# weatherApp
This application gives today's weather condition and the 10 day outlook by querying the API provided by http://openweathermap.org/.

Once the page loads, the application determines the users location if allowed. If the current location is given, the current and extended forecast will be returned.

The user can search for weather based on city name or zip code.
